# Change Log

## 1.0.2 - Bug Fix

- Fixed a bug where manifests that included numbers for compatible versions would fail to load properly.


## v1.0.1 - Fixes

A small fix with this release:

- Updated the Label on the badge so that if only 1 version of foundry is supported the text says version instead of versions.

## v1.0.0 - Initial Release

This is the initial release of the service. Only a single badge is currently supported it is:

- **Supported Foundry Version**: This route will read a package's module.json file and generate a badge the details the versions of Foundry the package works with. More details can be found [here](./README.md#supported-foundry-version).
